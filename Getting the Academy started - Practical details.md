Digital DHIS2 Academies 

These Academies reach a wider target audience by engaging our users who cannot attend onsite trainings because of the current 
travel restrictions. Other challenges may also prevent learners from attending:
- When participants are located in different areas with limited time and/or resources;
- Professional commitments which do not allow them to attend courses on specific dates with a fixed schedule; 
- Limited daily time to devote to learning;
- Restricted in their mobility because of security reasons;


* Digital Academies Tools - 

1) Learning resources on OpenedX: Documents, PowerPoint presentations, videos or audio files
Platform: OpenedX or Moodle

2) Communication tools:
a) Discussion forums, chats
- Platforms: Zoom or Open edX or Slack

b) Video conferencing 
Platform: Zoom


* Method of delivery: 

1) Synchronous: Live sessions
It allows an interactive exchange with participants. Then will be recorded to be re-included into OpenedX
Platform to use: Zoom

a) Advice when using Zoom
-	Always mute participants on entry and making sure participants cannot unmute themselves (there is an actual feature for that)
- Participants video off
-	Setting up the chat box so that either it is disabled, or questions are only visible by the main host if needed. 
Hence it does not disturb the session.

2) Asynchronous sessions: meaning pre-recorded
Participants will have access to them at any time. This can for instance include demo. 
Including pre-recorded sessions is also a good way to free some time for instance online support.


* Facilitation

Facilitators will be available throughout the course and respond to questions as quickly as possible so that participants can 
proceed with their work and remain motivated. 
The facilitators continuous presence throughout the process is crucial to assure participants’ motivation and reduce abandon rates 
considerably. Facilitators shall be available every day of the training.

Facilitators shall represent the region so collaboration with other HISP partners is important.

- At least 1 facilitator for live sessions
- A least facilitator for live events
- At least : 1 facilitator for digital support: the one participants will approach with any questions; so has to be available throughout the course and respond to questions as quickly as possible so that participants can proceed with their work and remain motivated 
- If group sessions: 1 facilitator per group is advised
- Platform specialist from UiO on the deck as well to assist


* Duration of the digital Academy

The existing material would need to be sequenced so that the curriculum fit an online learning format
Approx. 3 hours a day over 10 days. A total of 11 days as follows:

a) 1 onboarding day: Usually the day right before the launching date
This onboarding day is the opportunity to introduce the digital Academy format, to virtually meet with participants, 
to get them familiarise with the learning and communication tools, to test their own equipment and to meet with the facilitators' team
from the HISP group. All the confirmed participants are required to attend the onboarding day.

b) 10 days of learning
Approx. 40 hours in total: approx. 3 hours per day spread over 10 days, from the launching day. This might be subject to change. 


* The Academy webpage

Digital Academy website: It does not change much from the onsite Academies except few more information to be added:
- Commitment notes required from participants
- Agenda
- Advantages of the digital workshop
* Free of charge
* Same curriculum than the onsite Academies
* Team of DHIS2 experts conducting the Academy
* Being trained in safety, from your home or office during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Get an official DHIS2 certificate(1)
(1) Certificate earned by attending all the sessions, participating in all activities and completing the assignments within deadlines.


* Registration process

- If the onsite Academy for the same region and same specialization had already few registrations before getting cancelled, it is advised to
reaching out to these participants first and giving them priority.
- Ceiling number for the total number of participants to be determined with UiO

1) Participants' registration
Step 1: Once registered, HISP group will send a commitment note which will mention the nature of the training, duration and 
modalities of participation. This commitment note aims at explaining to the participants the prerequisites and rules they need to comply
with in order to get the official DHIS2 certificates at the end of the digital Academy.

- Step 2: Participants who completed the step 1, meaning sending the signed version of the agreement (participants' signature and/or 
employer's), the HISP group will send within 7 days, an acceptance letter, the agenda and an evaluation quiz. 

- Step 3: Once we have the quiz results, participants will be receive the final confirmation and credentials to log in for the 
Onboarding day


* Certification

Participants will get an official certificate only if attending all the sessions and completing the assignments on time. 
The method of delivery will not be mentioned on the certificate.
