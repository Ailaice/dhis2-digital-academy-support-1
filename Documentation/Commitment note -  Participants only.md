# Commitment of the participants

## Introduction

In our very first initiative of an online academy we feel commitment from the participant  is primary and non negotiable. The first prerequisite then is the participant’s presence throughout the duration of the academy and active participation during the sessions and activities, whether they are synchronous or asynchronous, individual or in groups. All these elements are key components in the certification process and compliance is necessary
We insist on the importance of participants’ commitment to ensure attendance in all sessions and activities.

The second prerequisite leading to a successful Academy is the participant’s professional environment. A conducive work environment  shall encourage  practise of   skills and knowledge newly acquired  during the Academy.

By signing this agreement, the participant agrees to the following:

* Allocate time to sessions and activities included in the programme, in order to improve individual competence and knowledge which can be used later in a professional environment.
* The training hours will probably be scheduled during daytime. A schedule will be shared very soon.
* Put into practise the newly acquired competency during and after the Academy.
