# COMMITMENT NOTE (Participants and Managers)

Introduction
In our very first initiative of an online academy we feel commitment from the participant  is primary and non negotiable. The first 
prerequisite is the participant’s presence and active participation during the sessions and activities, whether they are synchronous or 
asynchronous, individual or in groups. All these elements are key components in the certification process.
We are also insisting on the importance of participants’ and their managers’ commitments to ensure the attendance to all the sessions 
and activities.

The second prerequisite leading to a successful Academy is the participant’s professional environment. The work environment shall 
encourage the practise of all the skills and knowledge newly acquired during the Academy.

By signing this agreement, the Academy participant and the manager agree on the following: 

* Enabling the participant to allocate the required time slots to the sessions and activities included in the programme, even during 
working hours. This would be  in order to improve the competences and knowledge to be used afterwards in the professional environment. 
The training hours will probably be scheduled during daytime. A schedule will be submitted very soon. 
* Provide a  environment enabling to practise the new competences
* Managers will play an important role in supporting the participant during the Academy and afterwards, in using the newly acquired skills.
