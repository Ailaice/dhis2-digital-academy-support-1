## Ce que nous allons faire ensemble - et comment y arriver ? / What we are going to do together – and how do we get there?

Notre objectif est de vous aider à faire basculer rapidement et concrètement votre événement sur le numérique. /Our purpose is to help you quickly and practically pivot your event to digital.

Les activités et les conseils sont destinés à vous aider à démarrer notre processus en 4 étapes : / Activities and guidance are intended to help you get started with our 4-step process:

1. **Analyse des problèmes** (Poser les bonnes questions) / **Problem analysis** (Asking the right questions)
2. **Structure** : faire un diagnostic vos capacités et votre réseau, trouver les lacunes, puis trouver les bonnes solutions (technologie, personnes, processus. / **Structure**: diagnosis your capabilities and network, finding the gaps, and then finding the right solutions (technology, people, process.
3. **Culture** : rétro-ingénierie de ce qui fait que votre événement "marche", c'est-à-dire où se situe sa valeur réelle, en regardant notamment tout ce qui se passe dans le domaine informel, le hasard, etc. / **Culture**: reverse engineering what makes your event ’tick’, ie where is its actual value, looking especially at everything that happens in the informal domain, serendipity, etc.
4. **Exécution** : nous mettrons en pratique les compétences numériques tout au long de la formation, en vous mettant au défi d'enregistrer des vidéos, d'animer des sessions en ligne, etc. Nous repousserons vos limites avec de multiples plateformes, dont certaines sont vraiment horribles, afin que vous puissiez développer vos propres compétences pour évaluer ce qui fait une bonne et utile plateforme que vous pourriez envisager d'utiliser pour votre événement. / **Execution**: we will practice digital skills throughout, challenging you to record videos, facilitate online sessions, etc. We will be pushing your boundaries with multiple platforms, some of them really horrible, so you can build your own skills to assess what makes a good, useful platform that you might consider using for your event.

* In the academy many side meetings are taking place side events during lunch breaks, before, in between sessions.

* Connectivity and time zones
  * Connectivity: it seems like it more a question of affordability
  * Time zones: asynchronous

## Méthodologie / Methodology

* Session quotidienne de 30 minutes. Le fait de réduire le temps ne nous rend pas moins productifs, c'est pourquoi ces sessions ne durent que 30 minutes. / 30-minute daily session. Shortening the time doesn't make us less productive, which is why these sessions are only 30 minutes.

* Une période de deux semaines pendant laquelle vous travaillez activement à l'élaboration de votre plan. Nous partagerons des critères et des conseils sur les questions à prendre en compte et les problèmes à saisir à bras le corps. Cela vous donnera un plan d'action. / A period of two weeks in which you are actually actively workshopping developing your plan. We will share criteria with some guidance on what questions to consider and what you want to pull together about your issues. That will give you an action plan.

* Les deux semaines suivantes, nous utilisons un système d'évaluation par les pairs, ce qui signifie que vous soumettez votre plan et que vous pouvez ensuite examiner les plans des autres participants et leur donner un retour d'information structuré à l'aide d'une liste de critères. C'est une façon très, très puissante de réfléchir sur ses propres besoins, en regardant, en apprenant des autres, en voyant ce que les autres ont trouvé, quelles sont les différences, quelles sont les décisions, comment ils ont réfléchi à leur processus. Cette évaluation par les pairs basée sur des critères est l'une des activités qui devrait vous aider à accélérer, à clarifier la manière dont vous voulez aller de l'avant plus rapidement que vous ne le feriez autrement. / The following two weeks, we use a system where we do peer review which means that you would submit your plan and then you would get to look at the plans of other participants, and give them structured feedback using a list of criteria. And that's just a very, very powerful way of quickly distilling, sort of reflecting on your own needs, by looking, learning from others, seeing what others have come up with, what the differences are, what the decisions are, how they thought through their process. This criteria based peer review is one of the activities that should help you accelerate, to get clarity on how you want to go forward faster than you would otherwise.

## Challenges and opportunities of pivoting to digital

* Key decision points about, cancelation , postponement or the notice that you decided to pivot digital format that leads to a key statement.
* When you decide to pivot an event to digital in the face of a crisis, what potential implications do you need to think through and pay special attention to?  
* Need to over invest on communication.
* Even if you are not formally responsible for some areas (consequences of cancelation, refunds, insurance etc) of turning your event to digital, you still need to be deeply aware of the major challenges and opportunities involved.
* Need to think about the right format and adopt changes that can sometimes seem quite benign, but that can turn out to make a radical difference in terms of the outcomes, the quality of the experience, and the feedback you will ultimately get.
* one-off event due to the current situation or an approach that can be embedded or layed with future physical events to add a whole new dimension, a whole new way to augment the power of your event
* Need advice for the technical and operation choices for  different event types.
* adding values. What is the value people are actually getting from your event. Informal ones are less easy to pivot online.

## Key strategic questions to consider before you pivot

Before you start the change process to digital, Reda invites you to first think through a list of key questions:

* Review your purpose, mission statement and impact: *What is the change that your event aims to produce or contribute to?*
* Decision and risk management: What data do you need? *What do you need to know to make a decision about turning digital?* What decisions need to be made? Who's going to make those decisions
* Cultural dimension: *What is your organisation's tolerance for failure?* Is innovation leading change rewarded in your organisation?
* Budget: *What is the budget and the cost structure of your face-to-face event? Which parts of it can be adapted for use for a digital event?* Both in terms of immediate investment to deliver the event and investment to help build the infrastructure that might enable mew ways to work.
* Language: *What languages and time zones do you need to accommodate in your event?* The more time zones, the more asynchronous.
* Security: What are your security policies?
* Stakeholders: *Who are your stakeholders and what is their level of digital literacy *(how savvy are they in using the internet)*? What do you have to negotiate and with whom? Thinking of both the barriers of the physical* (travel, time, visa, ...) *and digital* (technology, literacy, connectivity, ...) *event.* If they have a low level of digital literacy, the event will need to build up, show them how easy it is or should be. Physical events have barriers too!
* Teams: *What is your role in the event? Who is in your team? Does your team have the transferable skills to pivot online? How will you and your team practice these skills?* Composition of the team is key. Knowledge an skills are not enough. Practice is very important, therefore there is a need for the team for opportunity for practice.
* Attendees: *Who are the attendees? What are their expectations? What are their likes and dislikes?* Need for reverse-engineering the event, meaning what is their experience as participants? What do they particularly appreciate about the event? Do they expect you to deliver on that?
* Tools: *What tools are available to you? What tools are you comfortable using?* You need to make a decision about which tool or platform to use and this is a consequential decision, but make sure that the tool is not a trap.t is not about to find the tools. It's about the competency, the capacity to judge an ascertain why such tool matters, despite those are not perfect It is a well how much you can allow for practice, for getting to know the tool, for mastering it.
* The most important: Facilitation: *How will you practice online facilitation?* Making the event easy and enjoyable. Digital facilitation has its own requirements and if a gap is identified, bridging it is about preparation, rehearsal, practice.


Change process: you need to think of it as a change management project. Leading change. it about how you are going to:

* facilitate that process,
* transfer the skills, practice the ones that you are not familiar with
* bring people onboard
* help people get comfortable and embrace the tools
